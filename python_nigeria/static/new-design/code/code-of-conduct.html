        <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
        <div class="conduct-section">
          <p>PyCon Nigeria is a community conference intended for networking and collaboration in the developer community. We value the participation of each member of the Python community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience.</p>
          
          <p>Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the conference and at all conference events. To make clear what is expected, all staff, attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers, and volunteers at any PyCon event are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct, as set forth by the Python Software Community (Python Nigeria).</p>
          
          <p>Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="conduct-section">
          <h2>Our Community</h2>
          <p>The Python Software Community in Nigeria (Python Nigeria) is made up of members with a very diverse set of skills, personalities, cultures, and experiences. It is through these differences that our community has experienced many successes and continued growth. When you're working with members of the community, we encourage you to follow these guidelines which help steer our interactions and strive to keep Python Nigeria a positive, successful, and growing community.</p>

        <div class="conduct-section">
          <h2>Community Interaction Guidelines</h2>
          <p>When you're working with members of the community, we encourage you to follow these guidelines which help steer our interactions and strive to keep Python Nigeria a positive, successful, and growing community.</p>
          <p>A member of the Python Nigeria community is <strong>open, considerate, and respectful</strong>. Behaviors that reinforce these values contribute to a positive environment, and include:</p>
          <ul class="conduct-list">
            <li><strong>Being open:</strong> Members of the community are open to collaboration, whether it's on PEPs, patches, problems, or otherwise.</li>
            <li><strong>Focusing on what is best for the community:</strong> We're respectful of the processes outlined in the community, and we work within them.</li>
            <li><strong>Acknowledging time and effort:</strong> We're respectful of the volunteer efforts that permeate the Python community. We're thoughtful when addressing the efforts of others, keeping in mind that often times the labor was completed simply for the good of the community.</li>
            <li><strong>Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences:</strong> We're receptive to constructive comments and criticism, as the experiences and skill sets of other members contribute to the whole of our efforts.</li>
            <li><strong>Showing empathy towards other community members:</strong> We're attentive in our communications, whether in person or online, and we're tactful when approaching differing views.</li>
            <li><strong>Being considerate:</strong> Members of the community are considerate of their peers -- other Python users.</li>
            <li><strong>Being respectful:</strong> We're respectful of others, their positions, their skills, their commitments, and their efforts.</li>
            <li><strong>Gracefully accepting constructive criticism:</strong> When we disagree, we are courteous in raising our issues.</li>
            <li><strong>Using welcoming and inclusive language:</strong> We're accepting of all who wish to take part in our activities, fostering an environment where anyone can participate and everyone can make a difference.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="conduct-section">
          <h2>Our Standards</h2>
          <p>Every member of our community has the right to have their identity respected. The Python community is dedicated to providing a positive experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, or religion (or lack thereof), education, or socio-economic status.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="conduct-section">
          <h2>Weapons Policy</h2>
          <p>No weapons are allowed at Python Nigeria's events. Weapons include but are not limited to explosives (including fireworks), guns, and large knives such as those used for hunting or display, as well as any other item used for the purpose of causing injury or harm to others. Anyone seen in possession of one of these items will be asked to leave immediately, and will only be allowed to return without the weapon.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="conduct-section">
          <h2>Consequences</h2>
          <p>Participants asked to stop any inappropriate behaviour are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in behaviour that violates this code, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, from issuing a warning to the offender to expelling them from the conference with no refund.</p>
        </div>
        <!-- Reporting Section -->
        <div class="conduct-section">
