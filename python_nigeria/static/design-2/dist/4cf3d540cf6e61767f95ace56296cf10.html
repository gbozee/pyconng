It is also the easiest to transition to because unlike traditional professions because all that is required is just a PC and Internet connection. But make no mistake, just because it is easy to transition to, do not necessary mean it is easy to master.
            Before deciding to transition into software development/programming, It is important to know what to expect and how to go about it.
            Some of the things you need to know are stated below
            
            1.	You are not going to be a professional immediately. This doesn’t mean you can’t produce useful software. 
            2.	Most of the errors you would run into why learning are syntax errors. 
            3.	You need to ask for help when stuck. This cannot be overemphasized. 
            4.	If you are learning by watching a video tutorial or reading a blog post, do not expect to get the implementation on first try. You would have to go through the same material at least twice.
            5.	Avoid picking programming books when transitioning into programming for the first time. Make use of coding sites and watch videos. There is a reason why it is said that a picture is worth more than a thousand words. Books only make sense after understanding some initial concepts.
            6.	If you can find others that are willing to learn with you please do. Learning programming is difficult and it is always good to have friends around you when learning.
            7.	You don’t need to learn all the constructs to build a useful application. What is important is having a simple project to base your learning on. Handle the simple case first. Don’t think about the big picture i.e how the whole application would work. Just focus on the current problem in front of you for that point in time.
            8.	If you are finding it difficult to come up with the right questions, Google away what you are thinking. If it is long, try making it shorter. If you run into exceptions/errors, copy and paste it directly in google
            9.	Most if not all the problems you would run into while learning are readily available online. 
            10.	Focus on one thing when getting started. This might mean one programming language, one framework etc. Don’t try and juggle multiple languages when getting started.</textarea>
